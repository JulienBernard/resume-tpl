# Resume-tpl #

An open and free **HTML template** to make your own **awesome resume**! Built with Sass, fully configurable. Wow!

## Getting started ##

### Requirement ###

Resume-tpl require [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/ "Click and go to nodejs.org") in order to run Grunt tasks and build properly the project (compile, minify, concat etc.).

But if you just want the original sources, you don't need anything in particular.
